%% Exercise 10

% We can check the roots of the characteristic MA-polynomial:
% The process is yt = eps_t + psi1 eps_t-1 + psi2 eps_t-2. Writing this in
% terms of the lag operator we obtain: yt = [1 + psi1*L + psi2*L^2]eps_t.
% Thus, the characteristic polynomial is psi(z) = (1+psi1*z+psi2*z^2). We
% need the roots of this polynomical to be outside the (complex) unit
% circle. Fundamentalness rules out the existence of z = 1 as a solution.

% The function "roots" compute the roots of a polynomial. We have to feed
% in the coefficients attached to the terms in the polynomial, starting
% with the one attached to the highest polynomial degree in descending
% order. 

% In this case we have psi2 attached to z^2, psi1 attached to z^1 and 1
% attached to z^0.
